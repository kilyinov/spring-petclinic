From analyzing the provided code snippets, there is one potentially concerning logging pattern in the `PostgresIntegrationTests.java` file, specifically in the `PropertiesLogger` class. This class logs all property values from the application's property sources:

```java:/src/test/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/PostgresIntegrationTests.java
        public void printProperties() {
            for (EnumerablePropertySource<?> source : findPropertiesPropertySources()) {
                log.info("PropertySource: " + source.getName());
                String[] names = source.getPropertyNames();
                Arrays.sort(names);
                for (String name : names) {
                    String resolved = environment.getProperty(name);
                    String value = source.getProperty(name).toString();
                    if (resolved.equals(value)) {
                        log.info(name + "=" + resolved);
                    }
```

This could be problematic because:
1. It logs ALL properties, which might include sensitive information like:
   - Database credentials
   - API keys
   - Security settings
   - Other configuration secrets

The only other explicit logging I can see in the provided code is in `PetController.java` which uses a logger but doesn't appear to log any sensitive information:

```java:/src/main/java/org/springframework/samples/petclinic/owner/PetController.java
private static Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(PetController.class);
```

Recommendation:
1. The `PropertiesLogger` should be modified to either:
   - Only log non-sensitive properties
   - Mask sensitive values
   - Be removed entirely if it's just for debugging purposes
   - Be configured to only run in non-production environments

It's worth noting that this appears to be in a test class, which reduces the risk, but it's still a good practice to avoid logging sensitive information even in test environments.
